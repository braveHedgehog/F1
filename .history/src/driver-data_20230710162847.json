        "Bio": "He's Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1's youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport's record books to the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso and then the Red Bull by the horns with his instinctive racing style.F1's youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner  at the age of 18 years and 228 days  with an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming.    Verstappen's no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained  and the victories have kept on coming.They culminated in his first F1 drivers' crown after that already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. And he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, winning a record 15 races across the season.The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick katrine Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of Dad's house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family, and though he's not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation's leading light are sky high  but with Verstappen there's a feeling that the sky's the limit.",

Never afraid to add a bit of spice to his on-track encounters, even his team mates don't always escape the Mexican's heat.Then on the other hand, Perez is a smooth operator, a master at managing tyres to eke out extra performance and give him the upper hand on strategy. A firm favourite on the grid after his time with Sauber, McLaren, Force India and Racing Point, Perez has matured into an analytical racer and team player.A proud countryman, the Guadalajara gunslinger has amassed more points than any other Mexican in the history of F1. In Sakhir 2020 he also matched hero and compatriot Pedro Rodriguez by taking the chequered flag in first a performance that landed him a seat with title contenders Red Bull.There he provided strong support to Max Verstappen's 2021 and '22 championship-winning campaigns, also adding a further three victories to his own tally. More wins may not be assured, especially with Verstappen as team mate, but Perez working hard and racing with his heart are.",

        "Bio": "Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation. Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories even when his car caught fire twice at Silverstone  to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits and earning himself a money-can't-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia's last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen. There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari's hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year. The 2020 and '21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to champion Max Verstappen.Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015. On the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud.",

After following in his famous father's tyre tracks, Sainz has had big racing boots to fill first at McLaren where he replaced his childhood hero Fernando Alonso, and now at Ferrari, in the seat formerly owned by Sebastian Vettel. It is never easy living in the shadow of sporting giants, but Sainz has shown the drive and disposition to deal with it, and in 2022 he took his maiden F1 win with victory at Silverstone. Vamos!",

Few would deny that he's in the conversation and what's more he's got there his way, twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to stereotypes for how a racing driver should think, dress or behave. Respect is hard earned in F1, but Hamilton now Sir Lewis Hamilton to be precise has it from every one of his peers. Why?

        "Bio": "He's the driver with the motto: 'If in doubt, go flat out'. George Russell has lived by it throughout his F1 career to date, out-qualifying seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie season, putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing his first race win with Mercedes in 2022.  That brilliant baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure. Spotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.  A refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass underpins Russell's winning mentality. And it's what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.  That star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.  He kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.It was an opportunity Russell relished, as he took his first F1 win and Mercedes' only 2022 victory in Brazil, en route to fourth in the drivers' championship, two places and 35 points ahead of his illustrious team mate.  If the Silver Arrows can produce a truly competitive car for 2023, a title bid surely beckons. A huge challenge, but as always, 'Russell the Rocket' will be going flat out.",
