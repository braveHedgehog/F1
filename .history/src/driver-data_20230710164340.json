        "Bio": "He's Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1's youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport's record books to the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso and then the Red Bull by the horns with his instinctive racing style.F1's youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner  at the age of 18 years and 228 days  with an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming.    Verstappen's no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained  and the victories have kept on coming.They culminated in his first F1 drivers' crown after that already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. And he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, winning a record 15 races across the season.The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick katrine Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of Dad's house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family, and though he's not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation's leading light are sky high  but with Verstappen there's a feeling that the sky's the limit.",

In Sakhir 2020 he also matched hero and compatriot Pedro Rodriguez by taking the chequered flag in first a performance that landed him a seat with title contenders Red Bull.There he provided strong support to Max Verstappen's 2021 and '22 championship-winning campaigns, also adding a further three victories to his own tally.

        "Bio": "Born in the Mediterranean idyll of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 on a tidal wave of expectation. Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories even when his car caught fire twice at Silverstone  to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits and earning himself a money-can't-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia's last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen. There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari's hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year. The 2020 and '21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to champion Max Verstappen.Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015. On the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud.",

Few would deny that he's in the conversation and what's more he's got there his way, twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to stereotypes for how a racing driver should think, dress or behave.

        "Bio": "He's the driver with the motto: 'If in doubt, go flat out'. George Russell has lived by it throughout his F1 career to date, out-qualifying seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie season, putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing his first race win with Mercedes in 2022.  That brilliant baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure. Spotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.  A refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass underpins Russell's winning mentality. And it's what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.  That star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.  He kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.It was an opportunity Russell relished, as he took his first F1 win and Mercedes' only 2022 victory in Brazil, en route to fourth in the drivers' championship, two places and 35 points ahead of his illustrious team mate.  If the Silver Arrows can produce a truly competitive car for 2023, a title bid surely beckons. A huge challenge, but as always, 'Russell the Rocket' will be going flat out.",

A serial record breaker in his early days, he was at one time F1's youngest polesitter, race winner, world champion and double world champion as he gobbled up success with the Renault team. Even Alonso couldn't continue that amazing run in his later career though, failing to add another title to his collection despite spells at McLaren and Ferrari.But after two years away from Formula 1 racing and with two Le Mans wins in his pocket Alonso returned with Alpine in 2021. His speed and determination undiminished, he was back on the podium that year, but frustrated by poor reliability and the lack of a long-term contract the following season, he opted to jump ship once more.Now Alonso hopes Aston Martin will be the team with whom he finally returns to winning ways, as he has unfinished business with F1…",

Then in Monza he mastered the downpours to become the youngest driver in history to line up on the front row. A single-minded starter, the Canadian loves to make up places on the opening lap and fight through to the points. Stroll has the potential to be a long-term fixture in Formula 1 as amply illustrated by a maiden pole and another two podiums in 2020.Those came after his father Lawrence led the consortium that took over Force India midway through the 2018 season, and then transformed it from Racing Point to Aston Martin for 2021. The future looks bright for both the team and their young driver and even if it rains then Stroll can keep on motoring at the sharp end of the pack.",
