        "track_info": " When was the track built? The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is, you won't be surprised to hear, a temporary street circuit (albeit adorned with some permanent sections), located on the Corniche a 30km coastal resort area of the ancient Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Designed by the Tilke company, in conjunction with Formula 1's own Motorsports team who used Google Earth for their initial investigations into potential layouts F1's Ross Brawn said of the track: 'What we want to see is a race circuit. We don't want Mickey Mouse circuits. We don't want those old classic street circuits with 90 degree turns. We want fast sweeping circuits, circuits which are going to challenge the drivers and they are going to love it.' When was its first Grand Prix? The inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix took place in 2021, the race joining its Middle Eastern counterparts in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi while like those races, the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix also takes place under floodlights.What's the circuit like?Fast. Very fast. Average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are around 250km/h quicker than those at Silverstone, and second on the 2021 calendar only to Monza aka 'The Temple of Speed'. It is, quite simply, the fastest street circuit ever seen in Formula 1 while the track also features the most corners on the calendar with 27, many of them quick, sinuous bends as the drivers wend their way along the Jeddah waterfront.Why go?The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix promises a sun-soaked festival of Formula 1, located on an idyllic stretch of the Kingdom's coastline. The on-track action is stunning, as the drivers get to grips with this rapid street track, while Jeddah itself comes alive as the city revels in hosting the F1 circus.Where is the best place to watch?The average speeds around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are such that any grandstand provides a spectacular viewing location. Nonetheless, the gladiatorial splendour of the grandstand surrounding the banked Turn 13 corner makes for a very special spot for F1 fans.",

        "track_info": "When was the track built? The deal to host Formula 1 in Melbourne was done in 1993, with the decision taken to create a circuit using a mixture of the existing roads around the city's Albert Park mainly Aughtie Drive and Lakeside Drive if you fancy driving it yourself with a little detour through the Lakeside Stadium's car park. When was its first Grand Prix? Just four months after Adelaide held its last Australian Grand Prix at the end of 1995, the Formula 1 teams were back in Australia for Melbourne's first Grand Prix at the start of 1996. That race is most often remembered for Martin Brundle's infamous Jordan crash at Turn 3 after he launched himself off the back of Johnny Herbert's Sauber.What's the circuit like?As a temporary facility, Albert Park can be quite bumpy - though resurfacing for 2022 will no doubt improve matters - while the circuit at the start of the weekend is often slippery, rubbering in as the sessions progress. It's also a circuit that requires a well-sorted chassis, with several spots on the track where the drivers require a reactive front end to allow them to chuck it into a corner. Melbourne is also one of the faster tracks on the calendar, with Lewis Hamilton's 2019 pole lap set at an average of over 235km/h.Why go? Often found on lists of the world's best cities, Melbourne is a blast all year round and it only gets better when Formula 1 rolls into town. There are bars and restaurants aplenty, you're right by the beach, while the race's appearance at the start of Australia's autumn means the temperatures should be peachy. Where is the best place to watch? If you want to get in a grandstand, opt for either the Waite stand overlooking Turn 10, or the Brabham Grandstand on the outside of Turn 2 to watch cars jostling for position through the first chicane. Alternatively, there are some nice general admission spots on the far side of the lake go for either between Turns 8-9 or 9-10 if you fancy some F1 picnic feels.",

        "track_info": "When was the track built? It wasn't Baku is the newest street circuit on the Formula 1 calendar, joining the ranks of Monaco, Melbourne and Singapore.When was its first Grand Prix?The first Grand Prix in Baku was held in 2016, as the European Grand Prix. That was followed by the inaugural Azerbaijan Grand Prix in 2017, which witnessed one of the biggest upsets of the season, with Daniel Ricciardo winning out from Valtteri Bottas and the Williams of Lance Stroll, while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel engaged in some argy-bargy behind the Safety Car.What's the circuit like?A mixture of wide and open and tight and twisty. The lonnnnng main straight along the Baku shoreline is a slipstreaming mecca, and with cars able to run three abreast into Turn 1, the action often looks more IndyCar than F1. However from there, the track loops around into the city's narrow, winding Icheri Sheher old town, dramatically wending past Baku's medieval city walls. As in Monaco, slightest mistakes are punished quickly and severely, while set-up wise, the teams are forced to choose between downforce for the twisty bits and less drag for the straight.Why go?As with all city tracks, spectating at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix means that you're right in the middle of the action when the cars get put back in their boxes. Baku itself is a buzzing city, while food is a key part of Azerbaijan's culture, incorporating elements of Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisine so eat up!Where is the best place to watch?The principal Absheron grandstand at the end of the main straight should be high up on your viewing wish-list, as you'll be watching the cars braking from around 350km/h into the 90-degree Turn 1 and you'll likely get to watch the lion's share of overtaking too. Elsewhere, the Icheri Sheher grandstand provides a unique vantage point, as you watch the cars wriggle through the city gate section and power on down to the super-fast Turn 13-15 complex.",

Set in the Hard Rock Stadium complex in Miami Gardens, home to the NFL's famous Miami Dolphins franchise, the track is the culmination of a development process that simulated no less than 36 different layouts before settling on a thrilling, 19-turn lap that provides a street circuit vibe, not dissimilar to Melbourne's Albert Park.When was its first Grand Prix?The inaugural Miami Grand Prix took place in 2022, the Florida race joining its Texan counterpart in Austin to become the second US race on the calendar and the 11th different American venue to host a round of the Formula 1 world championship.What's the circuit like?A street-track spectacular. With the Hard Rock Stadium at its epicentre, the 5.41km layout features 19 corners, three straights, three DRS zones, and top speeds of over 340km/h. There are elevation changes too, the main one found between Turns 13 and 16, with the track heading over an exit ramp and under various flyovers across uneven ground. The Turn 14-15 chicane, meanwhile, has an uphill approach, with a crest in the middle, and then drops down on exit.Why go?The Hard Rock Stadium knows how to put on a show it has hosted six Super Bowls, two Baseball World Series and numerous rock concerts. Put it at the heart of a track designed to encourage close racing while meeting the highest safety standards and you have a sure-fire winner for spectators. Then there's Miami itself famed for its sandy beaches, art deco vibe, vibrant multiculturalism and rich sporting heritage, it's an essential destination for those visiting the Sunshine State.Where is the best place to watch?When viewing a sporting event in a purpose-built stadium, it's hard to go wrong. In fact, you could walk around the top deck of the Hard Rock Stadium and see every corner of the track pretty unique. As for the best passing spots, a seat near Turns 1, 11 or 17 should put you in the thick of the action.",

        "track_info": "When was the track built? Imola or the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari as it's been known since 1988 had its foundation stone laid in March 1950. It was ready for testing by October 1952, while racing began at the circuit in 1953.When was its first Grand Prix?Imola first hosted a non-championship F1 race in 1963, but it would take some politicking with Monza in 1980 before the track was awarded the honour of hosting the Italian Grand Prix for the first time that year. From 1981, the two tracks worked together in perfect harmony, with Imola taking on its famous 'San Marino' title, and going on to host a total of 27 Grands Prix up until 2006. It returned as venue for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in 2020.What's the circuit like?A thrill ride. After testing his AlphaTauri AT01 at the track in the build-up to the 2020 season, Pierre Gasly called the experience one of the best he'd ever had in a Formula 1 car, while his then-team mate Daniil Kvyat remarked that 'an F1 car through corners like Acque Minerali the entrance is so fast, it's so cool. It really gives you a lot of adrenaline.' The anti-clockwise circuit is certainly fast, with an old-school feel as the drivers put it on the line in iconic corners like the aforementioned Acque Minerali and Piratella.Why go?Like neighbouring Mugello, Imola is nestled in a fantastic part of the world, with the Tuscan hills to the south, the Adriatic beaches to the east and the gastronomic delights of cities like Bologna, Parma and Modena to the west as well as the F1 mecca that is Ferrari's HQ in nearby Maranello. There's also no getting around the fact that a visit to Imola is an opportunity for F1 fans to pay their respects to Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, who lost their lives at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.Where is the best place to watch?The stand on the outside of Acque Minerali is a great spot to see an F1 machine being pushed to its absolute limits, as the drivers struggle to get the cars down to speed for the tight right-hander before blasting back up the hill to the Variante Alta chicane.",

        "track_info": "When was the track built? In 1215, sort of  that's when Monaco was first established as a colony of Genoa. When was its first Grand Prix?It was 1929 when racing engines first reverberated around the Principality, after cigarette manufacturer Antony Noghes decided to organise a race with his pals from the Automobile Club de Monaco. The race was part of the calendar in the first year of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, and hasn't been off it since 1955.What's the circuit like?Incredibly narrow and totally iconic. Nelson Piquet memorably described driving around Monaco as 'like riding a bicycle around your living room'… which is fair. Despite that, it's a challenge that nearly all drivers love, forcing them to put their skills on the line and rewarding millimetric accuracy. Overtaking on the tight streets is harder, however, with the 2003 Grand Prix witnessing a grand total of zero passing moves!Why go?A holiday on the French Riviera, plus the chance to watch Formula 1 cars pounding past places where Monegasques usually go to buy a pint of milk? It really is as fun as it sounds. On top of that, the chance to walk the track after a day's hard lapping or even enjoy your dinner on it at one of the terrasse bars is not to be missed.Where is the best place to watch?Assuming you can't get into one of the overhanging apartment blocks around the circuit (or onto a boat) shoot for anything from Grandstands L to P, which are clustered around the Swimming Pool section of the track, and where drivers hurl their cars through the tight chicane at 200km/h.

        "track_info": "When was the track built? The Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya was built as part of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics development programme. The foundation stone was laid in 1989, while the first car race was a round of the 1991 Spanish Touring Car Championship.When was its first Grand Prix?Two weeks after the touring cars raced at Barcelona, it was Formula 1's turn. The track enjoyed a sensational debut, with Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna's famous eyeball-to-eyeball drag race down the straight, before Mansell took the lead and drove on to victory.What's the circuit like?The drivers love the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, which is just as well, as they have traditionally spent huge amounts of time pounding around it during winter testing. The track is a good mix of high- and low-speed corners, with the challenging Turn 3 right-hander a great chance to evaluate the balance of the car your team's designers have given you to fight with for the season.Why go?You don't need us to tell you that Barcelona is one of the world's great cities, even if we just sort of did. Food, culture, beaches it's all there, making a Spanish Grand Prix holiday a properly attractive proposition.Where is the best place to watch?You've got plenty of choice, with almost the whole track overlooked by grandstands or general admission areas. On the outside of Turn 1, Grandstand A will let you see the best overtaking spot on the track, while the general admission area around Turn 3 will provide the awe-inspiring sight of Formula 1 cars being pushed to the limit of their downforce capabilities.",
