    "Bio": "He's Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1's youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport's record books to the limit. The baby-faced Dutchman with the heart of a lion took the Toro Rosso and then the Red Bull by the horns with his instinctive racing style.F1's youngest points scorer soon became its youngest race winner  at the age of 18 years and 228 days  with an opportunistic but controlled drive on debut for Red Bull in Barcelona 2016. A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming.    Verstappen's no-holds-barred attitude and hard defending have sometimes landed him in hot water with his peers and paymasters. But the mistakes that initially marred his potential have given way to maturity, while the bravado and energy that make him a blockbuster talent have remained  and the victories have kept on coming.They culminated in his first F1 drivers' crown after that already legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021. And he followed that up with a powerhouse title defence in 2022, winning a record 15 races across the season.The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and super-quick katrine Mum Sophie Kumpen, racing runs through his genes. Despite moving out of Dad's house to live in Monaco, Verstappen remains close to his family, and though he's not afraid to speak his mind, he can still be surprisingly shy.Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the next generation's leading light are sky high  but with Verstappen there's a feeling that the sky's the limit.",

Practically peerless on his way to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills from scorching pole positions, commanding victories even when his car caught fire twice at Silverstone  to an ability to muscle his way through the pack. Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.Stepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits and earning himself a money-can't-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia's last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen. There he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari's hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year. The 2020 and '21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to champion Max Verstappen.Out of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015. On the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud.",

    "Bio": "He's the driver with the motto: 'If in doubt, go flat out'. George Russell has lived by it throughout his F1 career to date, out-qualifying seasoned team mate Robert Kubica at all 21 Grands Prix in his rookie season, putting Williams back on the podium in 2021, and landing his first race win with Mercedes in 2022.  That brilliant baseline speed served Russell well as he totted up titles on his way to Formula 1. The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure. Spotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.  A refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass underpins Russell's winning mentality. And it's what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.  That star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.  He kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.It was an opportunity Russell relished, as he took his first F1 win and Mercedes' only 2022 victory in Brazil, en route to fourth in the drivers' championship, two places and 35 points ahead of his illustrious team mate.  If the Silver Arrows can produce a truly competitive car for 2023, a title bid surely beckons. A huge challenge, but as always, 'Russell the Rocket' will be going flat out.",

It was going to take someone very special to topple the Ferrari legend from his throne and that it was Fernando Alonso who did it, tells you all you need to know about the Spaniard.Fiercely competitive, Alonso is not shy about his talent, rating himself as 9/10 'in everything', and few in the know would disagree, with his performances in F1 characterised by blistering speed, brilliant tactical thinking, exemplary race craft, a razor-sharp eye for detail and a relentless determination to win.  A serial record breaker in his early days, he was at one time F1's youngest polesitter, race winner, world champion and double world champion as he gobbled up success with the Renault team. Even Alonso couldn't continue that amazing run in his later career though, failing to add another title to his collection despite spells at McLaren and Ferrari.But after two years away from Formula 1 racing and with two Le Mans wins in his pocket Alonso returned with Alpine in 2021. His speed and determination undiminished, he was back on the podium that year, but frustrated by poor reliability and the lack of a long-term contract the following season, he opted to jump ship once more.Now Alonso hopes Aston Martin will be the team with whom he finally returns to winning ways, as he has unfinished business with F1…",

Then in Monza he mastered the downpours to become the youngest driver in history to line up on the front row. A single-minded starter, the Canadian loves to make up places on the opening lap and fight through to the points. Stroll has the potential to be a long-term fixture in Formula 1 as amply illustrated by a maiden pole and another two podiums in 2020.Those came after his father Lawrence led the consortium that took over Force India midway through the 2018 season, and then transformed it from Racing Point to Aston Martin for 2021.

Backed by Mercedes, he won the GP3 title the following year and was halfway through a season of DTM in 2016 when he was offered the chance to replace Rio Haryanto at the minnow Manor team from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards.That opportunity led to a full-time seat the following year with Force India, where his wheel-to-wheel duels with highly-rated team mate Sergio Perez quickly marked him out as a rising star. But when Lawrence Stroll, father of racer Lance, stepped in midway through 2018 to secure the squad's financial future, the writing was on the wall for Ocon, who was moved aside at the end of the year to allow Stroll Jnr to join from Williams.Ocon bided his time, though, and after a year on the sidelines as Mercedes' reserve driver, he found his way back into a race seat for 2020 with Renault, who became Alpine for 2021 when his wait finally paid off, as he scored his and the famous French marque's first F1 win.Nothing in Ocon's motorsport career has come easy but if Ocon has managed to return to the F1 grid and step atop the podium, it's through a combination of self-belief, determination and a talent that's up there with the very best.",

    "Bio": "If there's one man who knows how big a rollercoaster ride an F1 driver's career can be, it's Pierre Gasly! The flying Frenchman was called up to make his 2017 debut in Malaysia in place of Daniil Kvyat and, after proving his mettle, he was named a Toro Rosso driver the following year.  A further 21 races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again this time to replace Red Bull big gun Daniel Ricciardo. Gasly seemed to have a knack of being in the right place at the right time a quality that's equally handy on track. A series of impressive 2018 performances for Toro Rosso including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain showed exciting promise for what he might do with the 'A' team in 2019.Unfortunately that promise only appeared in flashes and he quickly suffered from unfavourable comparisons with superstar team mate Max Verstappen. So much so that after the summer break, he was sent back to Toro Rosso, with another young up-and-comer Alex Albon being given a shot in the 'senior' Red Bull seat.But Gasly bounced back, as only Gasly can. In the season's remaining nine races he scored almost as many points as team mate Kvyat managed over the entire year and secured his best-ever race result with P2 in Brazil. That trajectory continued in 2020, peaking with an emotional maiden win at the renamed AlphaTauri team's home race in Italy, and didn't let up in 2021 when he was back on the podium and scored 110 of the squad's 142 points.When AlphaTauri's momentum stalled in 2022, Gasly decided it was time for a change in the form of French team Alpine, with fellow Frenchman and old adversary Esteban Ocon as team mate.  The question now is can he regain momentum and get himself another shot at the F1 bigtime…",

Bottas explains that if you can drive on the frozen roads of his homeland then you can drive anywhere. Then there's the Finnish mentality reserved, diligent and calm the fast lane of F1 doesn't faze him. Making his F1 debut with Williams in 2013, Bottas soon became part of the family. Points and podiums followed with the reliable racer even amassing the most points without a win, a record he resented but that showcased his ability. The fact the Finn was such a points machine saw him suddenly promoted to the most coveted seat in F1 - Nico Rosberg's vacant championship-winning seat at Mercedes.Bottas blossomed at the Silver Arrows in 2017, unleashing his pace to clock up personal pole positions and victories as well as a team championship for the famous Mercedes marque alongside Lewis Hamilton. He even tied with Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel with 13 podiums.For a shy guy, it brought a confidence boost and a new swagger albeit in a very demur Finnish fashion. He would need all that confidence in 2018 a season Bottas described as his worst in F1, as he took zero wins to Hamilton's 11. That, though, was a reflection more of his team mate's brilliance than of any shortcomings on his own part.Bottas stepped it up a level in 2019, four victories securing a convincing second in the championship behind Hamilton, but that dropped to two wins to his team mate's 11 in 2020 and then just one in 2021, prompting Mercedes to drop him after five seasons.In 2022 he started a new chapter in his F1 career, replacing compatriot Kimi Raikkonen to lead an all-new line-up at Alfa Romeo, and taking Chinese rookie Zhou Guanyu under his wing.",

    "Bio": "China has never boasted a Grand Prix starter among its citizens but Zhou Guanyu is the driver charged with changing that state of affairs, after receiving the call-up to make his F1 debut for Alfa Romeo in 2022.  The Shanghai-born racer attended his home city's inaugural Grand Prix in 2004 at the age of five, cheering on his hero Fernando Alonso. But having caught the racing bug, the Chinese driver then set himself the ambitious goal of becoming his country's first-ever F1 racer achieving a feat that Ma Qinghua, the only other Chinese driver to take part in a Formula 1 weekend, never managed. Showing boldness and dedication, Zhou put his plan into action by moving to England with his family aged just 12 to pursue his motorsport ambitions. A second-place finish in the 2015 Italian F4 championship proved Zhou was possessed of the right stuff a fact already noted by Ferrari, who'd signed him to their driver academy a year earlier. A move to Renault's academy for 2019 coincided with his debut in Formula 2, with Zhou building his confidence in the series via multiple wins and pole positions across three seasons, leading to him challenging for the drivers' title in 2021. That was enough to convince Alfa Romeo Team Principal Fred Vasseur to put his faith in Zhou for 2022 and field him alongside ex-Mercedes racer Valtteri Bottas allowing Zhou to achieve his dream of racing in F1, and even to see how he fares against his own childhood hero, Fernando Alonso.",

That word was Ferrari though it was with another Italian team that he got his big F1 break.Idolising Michael Schumacher and dreaming of one day racing in Formula 1, the junior Albon was pipped to the 2016 GP3 title by a certain Charles Leclerc. He then left his great friendship with George Russell trackside as he took the 2018 Formula 2 title fight down to the wire. Graduating to the F1 big league along with yet another contemporary Lando Norris in 2019, Albon did his talking on track with Toro Rosso in the opening races, earning a mid-season promotion to Red Bull Racing.A stylish over-taker with a championship mentality, Albon was unfazed by partnering Max Verstappen for the second half of his rookie season, taking top-six finishes in eight of his nine 2019 races with Red Bull.Staying in touch with the future champion proved tougher in 2020 and Red Bull dropped him from their race line-up. Crucially, though, Albon was retained as test and reserve driver, keeping him very much on team bosses' radar, leading to his 2022 return to the grid with Williams.Laidback and cheerful with a cheeky grin, the Thai racer is popular among his peers not always easy in motorsport's cauldron of competition but you don't succeed in Formula 1 by being popular. Albon's challenge now is a big one to make the most of a rare second F1 opportunity.",

It also convinced Williams to add the youngster to their books as he reached F2, where more race wins and another top-three classification in 2022 secured the Super Licence points required to complete the journey and graduate to F1 with the Grove team for 2023.Not since Alexander Rossi's quintet of appearances with backmarkers Manor at the tail-end of the 2015 season has an American graced the F1 grid, and Sargeant is looking forward to changing that across his first season.And with three races to be held in the US in 2023 trips to Miami, Austin and Las Vegas all planned America's latest F1 star will be spurred on by plenty of home support during his rookie campaign.",
